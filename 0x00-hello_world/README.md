## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google:**

## General
- Why C programming is awesome (don’t forget to tweet today, with the hashtag #cisfun :))
- Who invented C
- Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
- What happens when you type gcc main.c
- What is an entry point
- What is main
- How to print text using printf, puts and putchar
- How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof
- How to compile using gcc
- What is the default program name when compiling with gcc
- What is the official Holberton C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style
- How to find the right header to include in your source code - when using a standard library function
- How does the main function influence the return value of the program

## Requirements
## C
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using gcc 4.8.4
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the holbertonschool-low_level_programming repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, containing a description of the project
- There should be no errors and no warnings during compilation
- You are not allowed to use system
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

## Shell Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash

## More Info
## Betty linter
To run the Betty linter just with command betty <filename>:

- Go to the [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty) repository
- Clone the repo to your local machine
cd into the Betty directory
- Install the linter with sudo ./install.sh
emacs or vi a new file called betty, and copy the script below:

```
#!/bin/bash
# Simply a wrapper script to keep you from having to use #betty-style
#and betty-doc separately on every item.
#Originally by Tim Britton (@wintermanc3r), multiargument addedby
# Larry Madeo (@hillmonkey)

BIN_PATH="/usr/local/bin"
BETTY_STYLE="betty-style"
BETTY_DOC="betty-doc"

if [ "$#" = "0" ]; then
    echo "No arguments passed."
    exit 1
fi

for argument in "$@" ; do
    echo -e "\n========== $argument =========="
    ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_STYLE} "$argument"
    ${BIN_PATH}/${BETTY_DOC} "$argument"
done
```
- Once saved, exit file and change permissions to apply to all users with ***chmod a+x betty***
- Move the ***betty*** file into ***/bin/*** directory or somewhere else in your ***$PATH*** with ***sudo mv betty /bin/***
You can now type ***betty <filename>*** to run the Betty linter!

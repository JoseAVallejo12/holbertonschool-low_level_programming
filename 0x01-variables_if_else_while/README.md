## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google:**

## General
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
- What the the relational operators and how to use them
- What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- What are the boolean operators and how to use them
- How to use the if, if ... else statements
- How to use comments
- How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
- How to assign values to variables
- How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
- How to use the while loop
- How to use variables with the while loop
- How to print variables using printf
- What is the ASCII character set
- What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64

## Requirements
## General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
